# Node-RED Example: Orion - User Map

In this section you will connect the Orion Onyx using **Node-RED** and the [node-red-contrib-orion](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-orion) nodes to the Node-RED Dashboard and World map nodes.  The wav file will be transcribed into a text string and then the text will be sent to Sentiment Analysis. The Orion User info is queried for the GPS location.  A pin is dropped on a map and a gauge reports the sentiment.

### Map Location and Sentiment of the Onyx Users and Messages

Download the [flow](flows/) and import it into your Node-RED Editor.
