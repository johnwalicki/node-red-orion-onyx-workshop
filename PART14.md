# Node-RED Example: Orion - IBM Blockchain

In this section, you will connect the Orion Onyx using **Node-RED** and the [node-red-contrib-orion](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-orion) nodes, to a Hyperledger Fabric instance running in the IBM Blockchain Platform. The wav file will be transcribed into a text string and the Orion User info is queried for the GPS location.  The combination of user identity, location and message translation is written as an immutable transaction record on the blockchain.  This blockchain data can be used to provide provenance of the Onyx conversations.
